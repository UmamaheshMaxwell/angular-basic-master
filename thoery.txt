Features of Angular
--------------------
1. Two-way Binding  - Data binding is fast and automatic 
                    - Changes made to the view is automatically
                      updated in the component class and vice versa

2. Powerful Routing Support

3. Expressive HTML - We can use programming contsructs like, if conditions
                     for loops etc.. to render and control HTML pages

4. Modular by Design - Angular follows modular design. We can create modules
                       to better organize and manage our codebase.


Angular CLI
-----------
Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that use to initialize, develop,
scaffold and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell

1. npm install -g @angular/cli ( -g flag stands for global)
2. ng new angular-app (create a new folder)
3. cd angular-app
4. ng serve or npm start

component Selector
------------------
1. Selector can be directly used by typing element name or by attribute selector or by class selector

 selector : 'app-root'            <app-root></app-root>

 selector : '[app-root]'          <div app-root></div>

 selector : '[app="app-root"]'    <div app="app-root"></div>

 selector : '.app-root'           <div class="app-root></div>


 Template and templateURLs
 -------------------
 Temaplte - internal HTML
 
   template: `
              <div class="container">
                <h1>This is using inline template</h1>
                <h1> {{fullName}} </h1>
              </div>
            `,

 Template URL - External HTML file - './app.component.html'

 Style & StyleURLs
 ------------------
 Styles  : internal class

   styles: [`
                h1 {
                  font-weight: bold;
                  color: #00FF00
                }
            `]

 Style URL - External CSS File - ['./app.component.css']

 Data Binding
 ------------
 Data binding keeps both component and view in sync with each other

One-way Binding
-------------------

 Interpolation ({{ }}) - double curly braces 
  content inside the double curly braces is called "template expression"

  writing static text inside double curly braces

  {{'hello world'}} - Single quote
  {{"hello world"}}  - Double quotes

 Property Binding 
-------------------
   text = 'Welcome to Angular'
   isDisabled = false;
   url ="https://cli.angular.io/"

  <h1 [innerText]="text"></h1>
  <button [disabled]="isDisabled">I am disabled</button><br><br>
  <a [href]="url" [target]="target" >Angular CLI</a>

 Two-way binding
 ----------------
  firstName = 'Scott'
 <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="firstName" class="form-control"> <br>

 Event Binding 
 --------------
 fullName ='Tuan Bui'
 
<button (click)="getName()" class="btn btn-primary">Get FullName</button><br>

   getName(){
    console.log(this.fullName)
     this.fullName = 'Adam Colson'
     console.log(this.fullName)
   }

  
  Angular directives
  -------------------
  Angular Directives helps us to manipulate the developement

  we can chnage the appearance. behaviour or layout of a DOM element using Directives.

  They help us to extend the HTML

  Structural Directives                         Attribute directives
  ----------------------                       -----------------------
  *ngFor                                          ngModel
  *ngSwitch                                       ngClass
  *ngif                                           ngStyle

  *ngFor
  ----------
  Angular ngFor directive iterates over a collection of data. 
  like an array, list etc and create HTML element for each of 
  the items from a HTml tempalate

  It helps us to build lists ot tables to display tabular data
  in a nice way

  the syntax strats with *ngFor , The * represents Angular Template Syntax
